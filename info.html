<p>A new source of energy being used is nuclear energy.&nbsp;<br />There are two ways to generate it, one being nuclear fission&nbsp;<br />(splitting atoms apart) and nuclear fusion (smashing atoms together)&nbsp;<br />recently we have harnessed nuclear fission. While nuclear fission provides&nbsp;<br />a good source of energy, harmful byproducts are created that can cause&nbsp;<br />genetic mutation and have half lives so long it won't decompose for another&nbsp;<br />25,000 years. So now we're turning our eyes to nuclear fusion. The perfect&nbsp;<br />source of energy. No harmful byproducts and lots of energy. One problem: it&nbsp;<br />takes lots of heat and pressure to smash and combine hydrogen atoms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we have a solution. While technically some may see this as cheating we can use nuclear fission to generate that energy. Now nuclear waste is recyclable so we can use that waste to generate more energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
